3D Graphics Pipeline consists of 3 stages:
Modeling --> Animation --> Rendering

Modeling is the process of creating geometric models of objects
we're interested in. This could be a simple model of an object like a teapot. 

The next step if you want the objects to actually move is to consider the animation or the motion
of characters.

Rendering or creating realistic images, given the geometry and the animation.

HW 1: Transformations. Place objects in world, view them. Simple viewer for a teapot.
HW 2: Scene Viewer. View scene, Lighting and Shading (with GLSL programmable shaders).
HW 3: Ray Tracer. Realistic images with ray tracing (2 basic approaches: rasterize & raytrace images).

Basic Math: Vectors and Dot Products

Vectors are used to store offsets (смещений), displacements(перемещений) and locations(местоположений). 

OpenGL and GLUT
GLM library is available at http://glm.g-truc.net.
