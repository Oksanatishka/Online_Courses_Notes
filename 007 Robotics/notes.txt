Introduction to ROS
Project 1 


* Robot Operating System (ROS) runs on Ubuntu Linux.
Projects will be carried out in the Python language.

Robot
- Manipulation
    - [preprogrammed movement] Industrial manipulationa: manufacturing, assembly etc
    - [arbitrary movement, controlled by human] Robotic surgery
    - [arbitrary movement, controlled by human] EOD robots (robot car)
    - [autonomy, the need to react to environment] General-purpose manipulation (e.g. Amazon picker)
- Mobility
    - Wheeled robots
        - autonomous cars
        - more domains each day: warehouse, hospitals, hotes, the home
    - Legged robots (Boston Dynamics)
    - complete scenario: disaster response
    - aerial robots
    - underwater robots

Termostat from Nest (Google).

Robot is:
- a device that can sense, plan, and act
- a self-powered device that effects physical change on the world
- there is no universally accepted definition

* AI - artificial intelligence - the ability to react appropriately when faced with unforeseen situations.

ROS (open source)
http://www.ros.org/about-ros
ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software.
It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
- plumbing
    - code organization and management
    - communication between components
        nodes: laser driver --> localization --> path planner --> motor drivers 
        each node can be written in different language - Python, C++
- tools
    - intospection
    - visualization
    - ...
- capabilities
    - navigation (localization, path planning, etc.)
    - perception (object recognition, etc.)
    - manipulation (arm motion planning, etc.)
    - ...
- ecosystem
    - users
    - support forum
    - conferences and events
    - ...
