History of Linux and the command line  

Linux is a Unix-like operating system that is open source.
Unix, the most advanced operating system of its time that introduced many concepts still used in all modern OS.
1993 was the year of some very popular Linux distributions,for example Debian.

A command line interface, sometimes abbreviated CLI, is a human machine interface in which communication
between the user and the computer take place in text mode.

The elementary commands are of the form--
command options files_or_data
(the options and the files or data are optional.)
--------------------------------------------------------------
First commands: 
echo 'hello world'
echo $0 (this will not display $0. It will display the name of the interpreter of all the commands.)
date
cal
history
whoami (OR logname)
hostname (Gets or set hostname or DNS domain name. [name of the computer])
uptime (will display how many minutes until the system was booted & load average of the CPU.)
clear
uname (It will print the system information.)
uname -a (It will print all the system information.)

command not found
man
command options

SH stands for SHELL. It's what is interpreting the command on Linux.
So it's an application. It's software that will get all the lines.
When you type Enter, it will interpret them and do some stuff or ask the system to do something.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive commands: 
top     (display and update sorted information about processes)
nano
vim
how to get back to the prompt
--------------------------------------------------------------
Play with commands: (works only on weblinux)
hello
worm
firework
rain
hanoi
--------------------------------------------------------------
Filesystem, history, FSSTND, 
/bin    [binary] conatins all the basic commands needed to start and use a minimal system.
/sbin   conatins commnads executable so binaries - for the super user(root user)
/home   contains all of user directories
/root   home directory of root user
/etc    [editable text configuration] contains configuration files
/lib    software libraries required for executables in /bin and /sbin
/tmp    temporary files (sometimes it's located in /var/tmp or /run/tmp. It's emptied every time you restart PC)
/var    various files used by the OS, usch as db, email boxes and history.
A lot of what happened on the system is in /var/logs
/usr    unix system resources (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/lib)
/dev    [device] e.g. /dev/printer, /dev/audio, /dev/mem for memory, /dev/networkcard

--------------------------------------------------------------
pwd     [print working directory] when you log in the system you are in /home/user directory
cd
ls
absolute path (always starts with slash)
relative path

file    (to see info about file)
which   (to see the absolute path of a command)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Touch, rm, names with spaces

touch my\ file  (will create a file with a space inside of title)
touch 'my file' (another way to create a file with a space inside of title)
--------------------------------------------------------------
cat less

echo "hello world" > file.txt   (the output redirected to a file)
cat file.txt > file2.txt    (kind of copy)
cat > file.txt  (to write smth into file without entering it)
cat /etc/services | more     (to see content by page)
cat /etc/services | less    (to see content by scrolling page)
/   to search within the file (when you see ':' at the bottom of terminal)
--------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir, rm -r

rm      remove file
rm -r   remove folder (recursively)
mkdir -p D1/D2/D3   to create folder inside another folder
--------------------------------------------------------------
Unblock yourself in the command line

open a 2nd terminal --> top -> kill the process by PID
--------------------------------------------------------------
mv: rename and move
cp, cp -r

find . -name "program.c"
find / -name "hello" 2 > /dev/null  (find in whole system & redirect all error messages to a black hole)
locate filename
updatedb
echo p*     (to find all files starting with 'p')
echo p??    (to find files starting with 'p' but with three characters)

--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between interpreter and compiler

In C language we use a compiler.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Memory representation, RAM, cells, word, byte, bit, memory address

2 types of memory: 
- RAM     Random Access Memory (temporary memory) - used during execution
- Non-volatile memory (storage)

Manage the memory with the command line: free, top, htop

free
-b  byte
-k  kilobyte
-m  megabyte
-g  gigabyte

Memory consumption of a program using htop, virtual memory
--------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive programs in C using scanf, fflush
Donâ€™t use scanf, use fgets getline or readline
