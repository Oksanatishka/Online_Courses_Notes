APIS
List of APIs https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory
Free Styles for Google Maps https://snazzymaps.com/

Limit: 3000 requests per day

2 APIs: geocoding api (server side) and (client side to display map)

Example: I want the app to send text messages if a gig is cancelled.
Step 1: Sign up to Twilio.
Step 2: Fetch credentials.
Step 3: Write some Ruby.

    # Download the twilio-ruby library from twilio.com/docs/libraries/ruby
    require 'twilio-ruby'

    account_sid = 'ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'          # you get this info from twilio dashboard (it's like email & pw on fb)
    auth_token = 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'            # you get this info from twilio dashboard (it's like email & pw on fb)

    client = Twilio::REST::Client.new(account_sid, auth_token)

    client.messages.create(
        from: '+15551234567',           # Your Twilio number
        to: '+15555555555',             # Your mobile phone number
        body: "Hey friend!"
    )

Step 4: Run your code, obviously. (Your program sent a text!)


You can do http request in any language.


WEBHOOKS

Example: Every 10 seconds call the API to fetch list of Meetup attendees.
Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.
Meetup, please call my server as soon as a new member has RSVP'd
// The term "RSVP" comes from the French expression répondez s'il vous plaît, meaning "please respond." 
http://myapp.com/member_rsvpd for incoming requests

Webhook vs API call
Meetup  - through Webhook   -> My app                   - Webhook: Service A (Wufoo) pushes data as soon as available.
Meetup <- through API call  -  My app                   - API:     Service B (Trello) exposes methods to read, create or update data.

Lead management:
- https://www.wufoo.com/ wufoo form to capture leads      - get leads from wufoo and push to trello
- trello for my sales team

1. To create a fake email address: Guerrilla Mail https://www.guerrillamail.com/
2. Enter wufoo website with fake email, create a form and test it by adding a new entry.
3. Go to trello with fake email -> create a new board
4. Create fake account on Zapier https://zapier.com/ (to automate some tasks) -> Make a ZAP! -> 
// zap - when on the one hand you have a trigger, and on the other hand - trigger.
-> connect wufoo (it's trigger) to zapier, trello (it's action).
