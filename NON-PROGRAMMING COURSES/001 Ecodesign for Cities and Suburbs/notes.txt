Week 1: Learning from Innovative Cities-Case Studies:
1) The Vancouver Urban Growth Model
2) The Helsinki Urban Growth Model
3) The Portland Urban Growth Model

Axioms of Ecodesign
1. Embrace and manage complexity
2. Make population and economic growth sustainable
3. Make all design processes interdisciplinary
4. Always require public involvement
5. REspect both the natural and the built context
6. Draw on many design methods

Four Urgent Sets of Issues
1. Adapting to climate change, limiting global warming
2. Balancing cars and other transportation
3. Making cities and suburbs more livable and environmentally compatible
4. Designing and managing the public realm


Week 2: Climate change
- Adapting to Sea Level Rise
- Adapting to Other Climate Risks
- Food Supply Risks
Alternative Energy Sources to Limit Global Warming


Week 3: Balancing Cars and Other Transportation
Three Key Principles of Balanced Transportation:
1. Give priority to the most active and sustainable 'modes' 
    'modes' - ways of moving around
    'active modes' - those ways of moving around that use human energy such as walking, cycling, skating
    'modal split' - the proportions for how people move around using the different modes available to them
    Priorities: Walking --> Cycling --> Transit --> Goods movement --> Private vehicles
2. Provide convinient and accessible transportation choices
3. Sustainable modes must be tangibly more attractive to be preferred by users

Week 4: Making Cities More Livable and Environmentally Compatible

Parameters for neighbourhood structure:
- 7-10 min walking radius (called '20-min community')
- 20,000+ residents
- 40+ units per acre (100+ units per hectare)

Parameters for neighbourhood culture:
- Local-serving retail
    - Food store
    - Pharmacy
    - Liquor store
    - Drycleaners / salon / barber
- Local public facilities
    - School
    - Childcare
    - Community center
    - Library
- Local meeting places
    - Cafes
    - Bars
    - ("third places")

Key reasons for social diversity
- Avoid gettos of one socio-economic group
- Facilitate mutual support among people with different needs
- Secure social stability and resilience
