IoT system (transportation of data): sensors and actuators --> controllers --> the Cloud.
Sensor to Micro --> Micro to server --> Server to Cloud --> Data moving in the data center.

There are different ways to transport data – known as protocols – and each have situations 
for which they are suited, and a way for the transport to happen successfully.

Types of networks:
1. Personal Area Network (PAN) or Wireless Personal Area (WPAN). Example: Bluetooth
2. Local Area Network (LAN); It is a wired or wireless (WLAN) network that interconnects devices 
located in a small, geographical area, such as a home, office, campus, or factory. Example: Router
WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network 
3. Wide Area Network (WAN). It  is a network that covers a large geographic area and connects LANs together. 
It is managed and owned by service providers and has a lower speed bandwidth compared to LAN.


Datagram (it's each piece of data (a collection of many bits))
Packet switching --> Routing
Host (it's an addressable (network identifiable) device that sends and receives datagrams). Example: PCs, 
laptops, printers, routers, smart phones, tables, sensors, cameras, and actuators.

Internet Protocol (IP) address
There are two forms of IP addresses: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 IPv6). 
Default gateway for a host is the IP address of the router interface that all hosts on one network are connected to.

There are two methods to assign IP addresses to hosts:
- Static (manual) configuration
- Dynamic (automatic) configuration

The Domain Name Server or DNS is where computers look up addresses. The DNS turns a request like facebook.com 
into a number (IP address) 157.240.8.35. If a computer requests a domain name and that server doesn’t have it, 
it forwards the request to another DNS server in a hierarchical structure.


The key components of networks are:
devices
media
services

Cables:
- copper
- fibre optic
- wireless

Network Interface Card (NIC):
- Ethernet NIC
- Optic fibre NIC
- WiFi NIC

1. Bandwidth - amount of data that can possibly flow. Measured in kilobits per second (kb/s), (Mb/s), or (Gb/s).
2. Throughput - amount of data that is actually transferred.
3. Goodput - amount of usable data that is transferred.

Packet Tracer is a visual simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems to help learners in the networking and IoT 
space. Anyone can download Packet Tracer for free. https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer

Mobile wireless technologies
Wireless technologies use electromagnetic waves to carry information between devices.
Electromagnetic waves (electromagnetic radiation) travel through space-time (i.e. they don’t need 
a medium like water or air), and they carry electromagnetic radiant energy.
Because they are waves they have a frequency and wavelength.

Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable 
two electronic devices - typically portable devices such as smartphones - to establish 
low-speed communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other.
NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems (in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards).

Layered network models:
1. The Open Source Interconnect (OSI) model
| Physical - Data link | - | Network | - | Transport | - | Session - Presentation - App |
2. TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
| Network Access | - | Internet | - | Transport | - | App |
Where OSI is a conceptual model, TCP/IP is a working model.

In Encapsulation – headers (and trailers) are progressively added as data moves through the layers.
In Decapsulation – headers (and trailers) are progressively removed as data moves through the layers.

Data link layer addressing - MAC addressing (media access control)
The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups 
of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens (-); e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-ab.

Subnet mask
An IPv6 address is a 128-bit value (remember IPv4 was 32 bit).

The information that a router uses to determine where to send a packet is its routing table.
Three parts of a route:
- The destination network address (and network prefix)
- The IP address of the next hop router that provides a route to the specified network
- The router interface (port) that connects to the next hop router

================================================================================================

IoT devices are usually placed in resource-limited environments, such as: 
- remote and isolated agricultural applications;
- mobile and lightweight medical devices that need be powered for long periods of time in a variety of locations;
- outside for smart city applications; and
- many other scenarios where there are power and network connection constraints.

IoT application protocols 
1. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) 
2. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
