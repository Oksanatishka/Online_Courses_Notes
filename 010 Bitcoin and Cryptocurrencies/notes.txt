==================== “What is Bitcoin?” ==================== 
* 1) Bitcoin is considered the first and the most widely used cryptocurrency.
* 2) Bitcoin lowercase refers to the actual units of currency.
* 3) Bitcoin is the inspiration for the blockchain, which is the underlying data structure of this cryptocurrency.
* A cryptocurrency is a completely digital, decentralized currency that is built using
principles of computer science, cryptography, and economics.
* A data structure is a virtual format for organizing, retrieving, and storing information.

A Bitcoin user will say that they have a certain amount of bitcoins, similar to how we say
we have a certain amount of dollars when referring to the US Dollar.
The Bitcoin blockchain in particular stores a permanent history of all transactions to ever occur in the history of Bitcoin.
This cryptocurrency is not backed by any central organization, government, or company.
Instead, Bitcoin is built by the users, for the users.
As we said, Bitcoin was inspired by the Cypherpunk Movement of the late 80s.
Cypherpunks advocate for the protection of privacy using cryptography.
They don’t trust governments, corporations, or large organizations to respect privacy.

The Bitcoin whitepaper, or research paper, was published in October 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
* Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, or a false identity, of an individual or a group of individuals.

So how does Bitcoin do it? 
- On a high level, the Bitcoin network validates transactions and stores the entire transaction history.
The Bitcoin network is a group of users communicating with each other as part of the Bitcoin protocol.

But what are the problems?
- there are no central parties to ask for information about user accounts, and there are no central
parties to kick out or censor malicious users.
- The most popular attack is known as the double spending attack, an attack where some value is used for more than it i’s worth.

So how does bitcoin solve these problems?
- the blockchain, and the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol


==================== Bitcoin vs. Banks ==================== 
Banks:
- manage accounts

Bitcoin:
- identity and account management are completely autonomous

Stage 1. Identity in daily life:
- Houses have addresses and mailbox keys
- Emails have aliases and pw
- Bitcoin has public keys and private keys

Stage 2. Transactions
* Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) - is bitcoin's model for transactions

Validity:
- Proof of ownership
- Available funds
- No other transactions using the same funds

Stage 3. Record Keeping
Distributed database structure: blockchain
which used for storing transactions to maintain a global record.

Stage 4. Consensus
to make sure that everyone agrees on the history of transactions.

The Bitcoin network requires Proof-of-Work to add new blocks to the blockchain. 

Pre-Bitcoin
The roots of Bitcoin starts with libertarianism (to protect privacy).


==================== Intro: Early Bitcoin ==================== 
Bad reputation due to its focus on privacy and decentralized nature.
- there is no central entity or court to fix any mistakes within the blockchain.
If someone found your private key and stole your funds, no one else can give your stolen
funds back to you.
Early Bitcoin was thus often the target of scandals, hacks, and illegal activity.


Bitcoin Bubble and Altcoins

ICOs - initial coin offerings


==================== Intro: Enterprise Blockchain ==================== 
While blockchain technology was initially developed to underlie cryptocurrencies, it
quickly drew the attention of enterprises, which wanted to harness the same technology
to create private or permissioned blockchains.
Thus gave rise to enterprise blockchains.
We’ve been talking a lot about public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Now we’ll be switching gears to see how blockchain fits in with enterprises, particularly
with banks -- ironically enough.
As a technology that was initially created to avoid large banks and powerful centralized
institutions, blockchain seems to have come full circle...


Banks and Blockchain
There are many different enterprise technologies in the space today: 
- R3’s Corda,
- Chain
- JP Morga’s Quorum and Juno
- Digital Asset Holdings

The Hyperledger project is an open source blockchain run by Digital Asset Holdings and
the Linux Foundation.
IBM’s Open Blockchain is a platform that is now part of the Hyperledger project as
“Fabric”.
The way that companies, especially financial institutions, have looked at blockchain technology
has changed drastically over the past few years.


Blockchain Community and Politics
There are a few different forums that people use. There’s 
- Reddit’s r/bitcoin, online discussion boards like 
- Bitcointalk.org, 
- Bitcoin meetups
- and conferences, 
- and Bitcoin specific IRC Channels.
There are also organizations like us (Blockchain at Berkeley), that are dedicated to discussing
and pushing forward blockchain technology.
